=head1 NAME 

End - generalized END {}.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use End;

    {  my $foo = end {print "Leaving the block\n"};
       ...
       last;    # prints "Leaving the block\n".
       ...
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module C<End> exports a single subroutine C<end>, which allows
you to set up some code that is run whenever the current block is exited,
regardless whether that is due to a C<return>, C<next>, C<last>, C<redo>,
C<exit>, C<die>, C<goto> or just reaching the end of the block.

To be more precise, C<end> returns an object, that will execute the
code when the object is destroyed; that is, when the variable assigned
to goes out of scope. If the variable is lexical to the current block,
the code will be executed when leaving the block. 

One can force premature execution of the code by undefining the variable
assigned to, or assigning another value to the variable. 

C<end> only takes one argument, a code reference. If one wishes the code
reference to take arguments, wrapping the code reference in a closure
suffices.

=head1 BUGS

Due to a bug in Perl 5.6.0 (and perhaps before), anonymous subroutines
that are not a closure will not go out of scope, not even on program
termination. That is why C<end> wraps the code fragment in a closure.

There is a second bug in Perl 5.6.0 (and perhaps before) why this is
necessary. If the code fragment isn't wrapped in another code reference,
the original subroutine will be blessed in the package, making that C<ref>
on that code no longer returns the right value.
